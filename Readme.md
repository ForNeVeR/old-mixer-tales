Quick start guide
-----------------

1. [Get INSTEAD][download-instead].
2. Put this repo in `games` (`~/.instead/games/` on Linux,
   `path_to_instead\games` on Windows.)
3. Start interpreter (`instead` on Linux, probably the same on Windows.)
4. Choose “Select game” item from the menu (the button is in the lower right
   corner of the screen).
5. Choose “Сказки старого Миксера” item.
6. Have a nice game!

*Note to developers*: there doesn't seem to be a way to hot-reload the game, so
whenever you change the code, you have to choose “Restart game” menu item and
start from the very beginning.
